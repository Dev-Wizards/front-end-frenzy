### How to Submit Your Work

Each participant will maintain a GitHub repository named `front-end-frenzy` where they will organize their code samples. For each week of the event:

1. **Create a Folder**: Inside your `front-end-frenzy` repository, create a new folder for each week (e.g., `Week1`, `Week2`, etc.).
   
2. **Upload Code Samples**: Within each weekly folder, upload your code samples for the corresponding daily challenges.

3. **Organize by Day**: You can either group all daily code samples together or create subfolders for each day (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.) within the weekly folder.

4. **Commit and Push**: After uploading your files, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

5. **Share the Link**: Once your work is uploaded, share the link to your `front-end-frenzy` repository in the designated Discord channel for review and feedback.

By following this structure, you'll keep your work organized and make it easy for mentors to review your progress.
