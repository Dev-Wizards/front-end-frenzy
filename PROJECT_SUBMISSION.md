# FeF - Project Submission Instructions

This is your chance to showcase what you've learned! You'll create a project using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> [!NOTE]
> **No worries if you just know HTML**, you're still welcome to submit that. If you need help with deploying to GitHub Pages, feel free to ask.

## Requirements
- Every project must be hosted via GitHub Pages.
- Everyone must have the GitHub Student Developer Pack. You can get it [here](https://gh.io/fffrenzy24).
- If you run into any issues, feel free to let us know on Discord or in person.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository with this format: `FeF-PROJECTNAME`.
   - Example: `FeF-ToDoApp`.

2. **Project Files:**
   - For beginners, use three files for your project:
     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - `script.js`
   - If you are an experienced dev, feel free to structure your project files in any way that suits your workflow.

3. **README.md:**
   - Include a `README.md` file with the following information:
     - **Project Title**
     - **Description**: What is your project about?
     - **Key Features**: What can your project do?
     - **Screenshots** (optional): Add images to show your project.
     - **What I Learned**: Briefly describe any new skills or concepts you learned while building this project.

4. **What to Build:**
   - **If you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript well**:
     - You can build any project you like.
     - Just use plain (vanilla) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - **No frameworks** (like React, Bootstrap, etc.).
   - **If you are a beginner**:
     - You can submit a simple webpage using just HTML and CSS.
     - Even a single HTML file is okay.
     - It's a good starting point!

5. **Coding Standards:**
   - Write clean, readable code.
   - Use proper indentation and naming.
   - Add comments where needed to explain your code.

6. **Submission Process:**
   - Push your final code to your GitHub repository.
   - Submit the repository link through the [submission form](https://forms.gle/5sLwXVTAaoQKmiKg6). The submission form will start accepting responses from 27 Sept.
   - The form will also have some feedback questions. Take a few minutes to reflect and answer honestly.
   - **Important:** Only those who complete the form will be eligible for swags.

7. **Deadline:**
   - Submit your project by **2nd October, 6 PM IST**.
   - Late submissions wonâ€™t be considered for evaluation.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

1. **Functionality**: Does your project work as expected?
2. **Code Quality**: Is your code clean and well-organized?
3. **Design**: Is your project visually appealing? Is it responsive?
4. **Creativity**: Is your project unique or does it show creative thinking?
